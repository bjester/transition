Transition
=========

A jQuery plugin built for managing transition effects, using native CSS.  This
essentially is the 'animate' handler, but for native effects.  Allows addition
of callbacks and adds a layer of abstraction for cross browser support.

To use, clone the repo, then issue the following in the project root:
```bash
$ npm install 
$ grunt build
$ cd build/
```
